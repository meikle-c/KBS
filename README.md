# Files
LuminolData.RMD - This file does a basic survey of the luminol assay from the KBS 2024 Congo Cohort. The file prints out graphs comparing disease versus control broken down by sample location and in the aggregate. It also includes the number of participants per sample location and looks for differences between sample locations (batch effects). All statistical tests are Student t-test. There is currently no need for multiple hypothesis testing.
